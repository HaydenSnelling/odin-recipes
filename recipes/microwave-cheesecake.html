  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This quick and easy microwave cheesecake is a perfect dessert when you're craving something sweet but don't want to spend hours in the kitchen. With a buttery graham cracker crust and creamy filling, it's an indulgent treat ready in just minutes!</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter (melted)</li>
    <li>8 oz cream cheese (softened)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1/4 cup sour cream (optional, for extra creaminess)</li>
    <li>Optional toppings: fresh berries, whipped cream, chocolate syrup, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Start by preparing the crust. In a small bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter. Stir until the mixture is moist and crumbly.</li>
    <li>Press the graham cracker mixture into the bottom of a microwave-safe mug or small bowl. Use the back of a spoon to compact it into an even layer. Microwave the crust for 30 seconds to set it, then set aside to cool.</li>
    <li>In another bowl, beat the softened cream cheese with the granulated sugar and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy. You can use a hand mixer or a whisk.</li>
    <li>Add the egg and beat again until the mixture is well combined. If using, fold in the sour cream for extra richness and creaminess.</li>
    <li>Pour the cheesecake mixture over the prepared crust in the mug or bowl.</li>
    <li>Microwave on high for 1 minute, then check the cheesecake. If the center is still slightly wobbly, continue microwaving in 20-second intervals until itâ€™s just set but still a little soft in the middle (total microwave time is usually around 1.5 to 2 minutes, depending on your microwave).</li>
    <li>Let the cheesecake cool down to room temperature for a few minutes, then refrigerate for at least 1 hour to firm up further.</li>
    <li>Once chilled, top with fresh berries, whipped cream, or your favorite topping. Serve and enjoy!</li>
  </ul>
