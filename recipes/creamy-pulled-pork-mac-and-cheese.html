  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 lb elbow macaroni (or your favorite pasta)</li>
    <li>2 cups cooked pulled pork (store-bought or homemade)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
    <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>Optional: Chopped parsley or green onions for garnish</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cook the elbow macaroni according to the package instructions, then drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes until the mixture is lightly golden.</li>
    <li>Slowly add the milk and heavy cream while whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Continue to cook and stir until the sauce thickens, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Lower the heat to medium-low, and gradually stir in the cheddar, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheeses until fully melted and smooth.</li>
    <li>Season the cheese sauce with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce and stir until the pasta is fully coated with the creamy sauce.</li>
    <li>Gently fold in the pulled pork, ensuring it’s evenly distributed throughout the dish.</li>
    <li>Continue to cook for 2-3 more minutes, allowing the pork to heat through and the flavors to meld together.</li>
    <li>Serve the creamy mac and cheese hot, and garnish with chopped parsley or green onions if desired.</li>
  </ul>
